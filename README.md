Deedy-Resume
=========================

A **one-page**, **one column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters particularly to an **undergraduate Life Science** student.
As of **v1.0**, there is an option to choose from two templates:

1. **InterFonts** - uses the standard Notion font, Inter.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Motivation

I wanted a prettier Deedy resume.


## Dependencies

1. Compiles only with **XeTeX**


## Known Issues:

1. Hacky space on the first bullet point in Experience.
2. Latex doesn't like how I included graphics, but it's functional.
