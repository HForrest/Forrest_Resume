Forrest-Resume
=========================

A **one-page**, **one column** resume template in **XeLaTeX** based off of the Deedy-Resume.

## Motivation

I wanted a prettier Deedy resume that included icons from Icon8 (aquired via education license)


## Dependencies

1. **XeLaTeX**

## Known Issues:

1. Graphics put up soft errors that don't impede compilation.
