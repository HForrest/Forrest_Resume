\italic{We partner with nature to create the products of tomorrow}

\begin{tightemize}
    \item Built hundreds of plasmids and strains of\italic{E. coli}using genetic libraries to improve titer and solubility of the target peptide. \vspace{-3pt}
    \item Created a Jupyter notebook with a GUI that was adopted by 4 teams to properly create sample relationships in LIMS, eliminating previously common errors.
    \item Produced protocols and scripts to increase the robustness, repeatability and decrease hands on time of 5 workflows by up to 90\%.
    \item Purified the target peptide using column chromatography and various PAGE
