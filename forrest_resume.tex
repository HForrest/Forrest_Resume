\runsubsection{Zymergen} 
\descript{|| Research Associate}
\subheading{Jul 2021 - Current || Emeryville, CA}\\
\italic{Improved titer of enzymes essential to vaccine production}

\begin{tightemize}
    \item Cross functional strain engineer embedded in the enzymology department.
    \item Built hundreds of strains from DNA part libraries using high throughput automation. Grew strains in up to 1L cultures, and purified target proteins using benchtop column chromatography.
    \item Developed new and improved existing lab and data management workflows; wrote SOPs and trained users. 
    \item Eliminated common errors by creating Jupyter notebooks that were adopted by 4 teams to simplfy and standardize data entry and manipulation into the LIMS system.
    \item Analyzed data and produced publication quality figures to present at team meetings using Python and JMP.
    \item Produced protocols and python scripts to increase the robustness, repeatability and throughput of wetlab work. 3500 fold increase in throughput of cell lysis.
