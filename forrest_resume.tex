\section{\icon{Experience.png} Experience}
\runsubsection{Zymergen} 
\descript{|| Research Associate II, Enzymology}
\subheading{Jul 2021 - Current || Emeryville, CA}\\
\italic{Designed, produced, and assayed enzymes in-vivo and in-silico}

\begin{tightemize}
    \item Pioneered the use of structure-guided protein design workflows using various bioinformatic and structural analytic methods (Alphafold, PyMol, Rosetta, GREMLIN, PSSM) to design improved enzymes.
    \item Designed and programmed various tools to enhance high throughput protein engineering efforts
    \item Automated high-throughput screening data acquisition and analysis via SQL queries and python notebooks, decreasing analysis turn around time by 3 days.
    \item Converted low throughput, low precision benchtop screens to automated high-throughput screens (3500x throughput, 7x decrease in CV, SQL query-able data)
    \item  Presented data and project updates at lab meetings. Multiple solo feature presentations at department meetings.
    \item Initiated collaborations across departments and across coasts that resulted in insights essential for project deliverables.
\end{tightemize}

\subheading{Sep 2018 â€“ May 2020 || Seattle, WA}\\
\italic{Agbio startup that develops endomycorrhizal fungi to increase abiotic stress tolerance}

\begin{tightemize}
    \item Fabricated and programmed a throughput image analysis platform for seed-microbe interactions, halving data collection time and increasing data precision five-fold.
    \item Conducted research and development with a variety of filamentous fungi, yeasts, bacteria, and plants by performing a variety of assays.
    \item Discovered a novel growth phytohormone synthesizing yeast strain for use as a symbiotic crop treatment

\subheading{Mar 2020 - Nov 2020 || Seattle, WA}\\
\italic{The University of Washington's competitive synthetic biology team}

\begin{tightemize}
    \item Gained familiarity with Rosetta and other structure-guided protein design tools.
    \item Lead team functions such as literature review, external presentations, and project design.
    \item Presented at an international synthetic biology symposium.
